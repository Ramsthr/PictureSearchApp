## Working of App

This project is a picture search app.

The Picture Search App's functionalities are as follows:

1) The objective of this project is to design and develop a mobile application that allows users to search for pictures.

2) The app includes a search bar at the top where users can input their query.

3) It displays the search results in a grid format. Each row in the grid should contain three pictures related to the search query, and there will be five rows.

4) On scrolling, more images appear.

5) The images are loaded in a paginated manner to improve performance (this means that the images are only loaded when the user is scrolling)."
